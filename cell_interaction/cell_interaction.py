"""
Returns matrix containing the log odds ratio between cell type X and cell type Y.
Dimensions: [n_cell_types, n_cell_types]

The log-odds ratio can be defined as the log of the ratio between the actual
frequency of edges between two cell types and their theoretical co-occurrence.

The actual frequency of edges between two cell types is defined as the
proportion of all edges that occur between cells of the two types. For example, 
if the sample had 5 total edges and 2 occurred between cell types A and B,
the actual frequency between cell types A and B = 2‚ÅÑ5 = 0.4.

The theoretical co-occurrence is the expected frequency of interaction between
two cell types assuming a random placement of cells. For example,
if 50% of edges involve cell type A and 30% involve cell type B,
the theoretical co-occurrence between cell types A and B = 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.15.
